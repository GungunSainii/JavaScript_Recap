- Wating - database value fetch or display or encription of crytographic value requires async programming 
Usually done by asyn or await || Promises 
Modern programming involves the use of Promises

A Promise is in one of these states:

- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

Promise -- The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
